            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sleep Beneath the Stars in the Italian Alps | Travel Away</h1><p>A brainchild of local hotelier Raniero Campigotto, Starlight Room Dolomites is a mobile glass-encased bedroom tucked away in the picturesque Italian Alps, 20 km from the swanky ski resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo.
